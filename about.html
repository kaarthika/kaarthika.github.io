          This is the personal website created by kaarthika thakker using HTML/CSS, last updated Feb. 21, 2021. The source code can be found on my github <a href="https://github.com/kaarthika/kaarthika.github.io">here</a>.

          kaarthika is a writer, artist, and organizer living in occupied Lenapehoking (Astoria, Queens). She spends her days using digital
          communications to fight for material wins for working-class NYers and organizing with our neighbors to build power in our neighborhood.
          She is also currently exploring stand up comedy, building a yoga practice, and birdwatching. <p><p>
          This page is both a final product and a work in progress as I further explore our relationship to code, screens, each other, and the world. <p><p>
