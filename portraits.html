        <i>This is a portrait of my face</i> was a collective project of 94 self-portraits
        made by everyone who entered our home in Houston, TX starting on 10/8/2019.
        The portraits were displayed on a wall near our front entrance for the duration of our lease. <p><p>

         <i>This is a portait of my face</i>, includes portraits from friends,
         exes, near-strangers, artists, and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vb7yv4/how-a-22-year-old-mayoral-candidate-wants-to-make-millennials-vote"> a former mayor candidate.</a>
         The project ended abruptly in March 2020, when no new visitors came to our home. The scanned portraits were converted
         into a book that represents collective vs the individual and self-representation vs surveillance. All the portraits can be viewed <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/6KoziNnDS8hT8i9N9">here.</a>   <p><p>
