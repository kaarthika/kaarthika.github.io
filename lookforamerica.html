Look for America explores the local & diy
music scenes of American cities in a
"road trip style" (each show is a stop that
focuses on a new city). I started Look for
America with my co-dj at University of
Edinburgh's online radio station
freshair.org.uk (shows here) and
continued it in Houston at KTRU on-air
with another DJ. is a on-air radio show
(ktru.org / 96.1 FM in Houston) .
