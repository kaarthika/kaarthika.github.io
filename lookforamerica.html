        Cameron and I djed Look For America on freshair.radio in
        Edinburgh. We explored local music & diy scenes of different
        U.S. regions where each show was a different part of our audio
        roadtrip. At this point, I had spent most of my time in Ohio and
        Texas, and Cameron in Arkansas and Colorado. The show was a way to share
        about ourselves, our friends' music, and share American diy music
        with a U.K. audience. You can listen <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/LookForAmerica/">here.</a> <p><p>

        I brought this show back to Houston, where Alec and I DJed Look for America
        on KTRU 96.1FM. The show still continues on ktru, but is now called the Road Show.
