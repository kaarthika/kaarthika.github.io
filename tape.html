      I developed this
       site-specific
       installation with a
       team of two
       architecture
       students and a
       sociology student
       for the 2019 Rice
       Architecture Archi-
       Arts Charette. We
       were tasked with
       creating an
       interactive
       installation that
       responded both to
       the event's theme,
       Circus, and a
       musical
       composition
       written by a
       student at the
       Shepherd School of
       Music titled
       "Debussy
       Palimpsest." The
       composition is a
       palimpsest â€” a
       piece that alters
       and writes over an
       existing form,
       bearing traces of
       the original.

       Our installation is a layered palimpsest. We layered tape over the site and the objects in it in a pattern that both referenced the tempo of the piece, as well as a circus tent's stripes. We then invited Rice Dance Theater to choreograph and perform a dance that disrupts the pattern by moving the podiums, thus overwriting the original form and creating something new in the process, as a palimpsest does.
       Our team won first prize and received a grant to install and removed our piece over the course of three days to coincide with the annual Archi-Arts Gala.
