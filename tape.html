        Alec (Sociology '20), Beril (Architecture '20),
        Stacy (Architecture '20) developed the idea for
        <i>tape, tape, tape, tape, tape</i> as part of the 2019 Anderson School of Architecture's
        Archi-Arts mini-Charette. The theme of the charette was "circus," and
        participants were tasked with creating a low-cost interactive installation
        that responded to an original composition
         <a href="http://www.paulnovakmusic.com/debussy-palimpsest.html">"Debussy Palimpsest"</a>
         by Shepard School's Paul Novak —  a musical vandalism of Claude Debussy’s
         <i>Sonata for flute, viola, and harp</i>. <p><p>

         <i>tape, tape, tape, tape, tape</i>, too is a palimpsest — the horizontal
         lines covering the room's existing walls, floors, and model stands
         to create a sort of palimpsest. Rice Dance Theater choreographed a dance
         for the space where they moved the model stands, creating a palimpsest of
         their own over our work. Gala attendees were invited into the space and
         for the duration of the gala, the attendees used the model stands as props,
         tables, and informal seating. There bodies became the final act of visual
         vandalism, becoming both performers and the audience. <p><p>

         With a grant of $500 from the Anderson School of Architecture, we
         installed <i>tape, tape, tape, tape, tape</i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5UixLpe11M">over the course of
         24 hours.</a>
