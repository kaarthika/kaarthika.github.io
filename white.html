**white/off-white**

Spring 2020

white/off-white was a collaborative
effort between me, a sociology
student, and 4 architecture students
for the 2020 Rice Architecture Archi-
Arts Charette. We were tasked with
creating an interactive site-specific
installation that responded to the
event's theme, Duo. Our work was
inspired by a definition of duo as *two
complete wholes working in harmony*.
We explored this interpretation by
dividing the installation into two
unique spaces with a suspended white
& off-white checkered sheet. This
created two dual viewing experiences
(outside, above, below, inside). The
two colors were chosen because the
subtlety of duality â€” the two colors
are indistinguishable until brought
together.
