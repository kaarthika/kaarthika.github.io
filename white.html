        <h2>white/off-white</h2>
        Beril, Stacy, Shree, Anna (all Architecture '20), Alec (Sociology '20),
        and I created <i>white/off-white</i> for the 2020 Anderson School of Architecture
        Archi-Arts Charette. The theme of the Charette was duo. <i>white/off-white</i>
        breaks up the room into two spaces 
        white/off-white was a collaborative
        effort between me, a sociology
        student, and 4 architecture students
        for the 2020 Rice Architecture Archi-
        Arts Charette. We were tasked with
        creating an interactive site-specific
        installation that responded to the
        event's theme, Duo. Our work was
        inspired by a definition of duo as *two
        complete wholes working in harmony*.
        We explored this interpretation by
        dividing the installation into two
        unique spaces with a suspended white
        & off-white checkered sheet. This
        created two dual viewing experiences
        (outside, above, below, inside). The
        two colors were chosen because the
        subtlety of duality â€” the two colors
        are indistinguishable until brought
        together.
