        Show & Tell was a radio show where my best friend and I invited
        guests, friends & strangers, to share music that is meaningful
        to them. We started the show at the end of 2019
        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ktru-rice-radio/sets/show-and-tell-season-1">live</a>
        on ktru (96.1FM).<p>
        Our last in person show took place on March 13, where we
        coincidentally interviewed the predecessors of our show, Lisa + Ant,
        who continued show & tell for two more seasons (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/ktru-rice-radio/sets/show-and-tell-season-2">2</a>,
        <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ktru-rice-radio/sets/show-and-tell-season-3">3</a>).
        <p>
        We continued the show into the pandemic, recording
        over zoom and posting them <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/tellandshow/">online</a>.
        <p>
        Show & Tell was an exploration of the roles that music plays in our lives,
         from <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ktru-rice-radio/varun-show-and-tell-11-13-19?in=ktru-rice-radio/sets/show-and-tell-season-1&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing">Varun's</a> first hip-hop album, to
        to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ktru-rice-radio/gray-show-and-tell-03-05-20?in=ktru-rice-radio/sets/show-and-tell-season-1&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing">Gray's</a> "happy, sad, listen to garbage" songs.
        <p>
        One of my favorite episodes was the one with Cameron. Cameron and I
        co-hosted <a href="lookforamerica.html">look for america</a> on
        freshair.radio in Edinburgh. Alec and Cameron had never talked before,
        but we talked about our private mode listens, reoccuring dreams, and
        why everyone should listen to more Nora Jones.
