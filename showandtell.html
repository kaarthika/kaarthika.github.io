Each week on Show & Tell, a guest brings a playlist of
music that's important to them. We talk through the
songs and try to elucidate what makes music meaningful
to different people as well as learn something about the
past of our guests. We were on-air for a semester, but
due to the COVIDî‚ˆ19 pandemic, we continued
broadcasting remotely. Our live shows can be found here,
and our remote shows are here.
